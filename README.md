# COMP6841-Something-Awesome-Project

Developed a voice assistant using Python that integrated with Google Chrome to perform basic tasks. The assistant was designed to receive voice commands from the user and carry out actions such as opening specific web pages, playing music and videos. To achieve this, utilized various Python libraries such as SpeechRecognition, to facilitate the voice recognition and web automation processes. The end product provided a simple and efficient method for performing common tasks through voice commands.

Just a small note, this program was written and tested for a system running Windows 10, and the executable file is less stable than running the .py file so unexpected issue may occur (should be fine).
